								</header>
								<p  style="text-align:left;">The President's Challenge 2022 was a highly anticipated event, and our team was determined to make a lasting impression. The challenge was to design and build a Rube Goldberg machine that would showcase our skills and creativity. Given the 6 weeks lead time, we quickly got to work and brainstormed the best possible design for the machine.</p>
                                <a class="image main"><img src="images/blog01_1.jpg" alt="" /></a>
                                Our team decided to focus on computer engineering and came up with a design that would sense a puck falling from a device behind us, activate a motor to pull a string, and shoot the puck using a puck shooter. The design was innovative and unique, and we were confident that it would be well received.
                                <a class="image main"><img src="images/blog01_2.jpg" alt="" /></a><p >
                                While the physical part of the module was being built, I was tasked with programming the Arduino to incorporate some fancy LED lights and a functioning SONAR sensor to detect the puck. This was a challenging task, and I faced several trials and errors. However, I persevered, and after several weeks of hard work, I finally got it to work.</p>

                                With all the pieces in place, it was time to put everything together and make the final run. </p>

                                <a class="image main"><img src="images/blog01_5.jpg" alt="" /></a><p>
                                The results were amazing, and everything went smoothly. The crowd was in awe of our Rube Goldberg machine, and it was a huge success.</p>
                                <a class="image main"><img src="images/blog01_6.jpg" alt="" /></a>
                                In conclusion, the President's Challenge 2022 was an incredible experience, and I am proud to have been a part of such an amazing team. The challenges that we faced along the way only made us stronger, and I am grateful for the opportunity to showcase my skills and creativity. This project has given me valuable experience in project management, problem-solving, and team collaboration.  I am eager to continue learning and growing as an engineer.
